Accuracy - # of correct predictions / # of total predictions
Precision - TP / (TP + FP)
Recall - Sensitivity = TPR = TP/ (TP + FN)
F1 - F- 0.5, 1, & 2 based on the measure of weightage given to precision over recall
AUC - Area Under the Curve#
MCC - Matthews correlation coefficient (derived from confusion matrix)
KAPPA - Cohenâ€™s kappa statistic is a very good measure that can handle very well both multi-class and imbalanced class problems.
